In Python, a function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a specific task. Functions provide modularity and help in structuring code, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain. Functions can take arguments (input) and return a value (output) or perform a specific action.They play a crucial role in code organization and reusability, allowing you to create modular and efficient programs.
